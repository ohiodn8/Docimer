# About Docimer

 Docimer is a simple Ruby on Rails 5 CMS for static pages. It is more of a Rails application that acts like a CMS; meaning its a built Rails application that gives you the option to create and edit its content.

The idea is to develop websites with ease (and without having to write codes).
